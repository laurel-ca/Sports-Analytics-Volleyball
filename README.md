# Sports-Analytics-Volleyball

This is was a working repository for my sports analytics class project.

The aim of this project was to analyze and provide recommendationf for a collegiate volleyball team. Currently, volleyball is a largely unexplored area for analytics so I was looking to explore which metrics might be most valuable for coaches and players.

For the project, I will be using data from https://github.com/macfields/mfields_finalproject. The data is collected using software caleed Data Volley, which allows teams to track play-by-play data. To parse the data, I will be using a package by raymondben that can be found here: https://github.com/openvolley/datavolley.
